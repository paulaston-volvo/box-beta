# Box Monitor Beta

##

### Construction
A general top-tip is make sure your workspace is clear that you have all the tools and parts you need. 
Tools you will need: 
- Small flat-head screw driver (2.4mm)
- Wire cutters
- Needle nose pliers
- Hot glue gun
- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Black nasty/electrical tape
- Multimeter


#### Step 1
Start by fitting the resistors to the board. Cut the legs short to ensure a tight fit into the board. You may want to use the pliers to help push the pins into the breadboard. 
The resistors should match the colours on the diagram. If they don't, here is a handy guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors/decoding-resistor-markings

#### Step 2
Start wiring. Try to cut the wires so they fit as snugly to the board as possible. _Use the single core wire_ for this.
Holes H1-H16 down to B2-B6 will be covered by the Fona board and unusable, wires can be run tightly under the board to the left of that.

#### Step 3
Place the Fona board into the breadboard (_Note: The pins will have to be soldered to the Fona board before insertion_)
You can skip this step and do it later if you wish.
Also remember to add the SIM card before placing the Fona board.

#### Step 4
Add the connectors from the status light LEDs

#### Step 5
Wire in the sensor cables from the box, making sure to match the colours! Also remember to run them through the hole in the box first!

#### Step 6 
Plug in the batteries and the GSM antenna and youre done!

#### Notes:

 - The small battery may not have a full charge which will affect the ability to send data, but when the board is plugged into your laptop to load the programme, it should give it enough boost.
 -  The big battery will only have a 75% charge when you buy it. Top it up from a phone charger plugged into the wall (not a laptop, it takes ages.)
